# Psychic-Game

Challenge the psychic! The game randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose. 

The app keeps track of the following items:

1. Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)

2. Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)

3. Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)

4. Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)

5. When the player wins, the app increases the Wins counter and starts the game over again.

6. When the player loses, the app increases the Losses counter and restarts the game.
